# Adventure Tools: Version Formatting & Use
Just because Adventure Tools doesn't have an official modpack, doesn't mean I don't have version formatting!

Sometimes, if I make a significant enough change to the mod list (including anything I use practically), I like to bump up the releases like they were a modpack or mod. Bumping up the version just gives me a reason to make custom titlebar windows when I distribute my personal instances for friends to give them a headstart into Minecraft modding.  
And that's why I version them. Because I like to keep a list of versions available.

And that's what this is! :P

Note that versions are updated based on mod additions, **not** when mods are added to the official research instances.
