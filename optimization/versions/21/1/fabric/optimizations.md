| [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling) | Unknown | Using async path-tracing to hide Block-/Entities that are not visible | Client | Has a very small chance to cause crashes in versions where Sodium is present. |
| [FerriteCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core) | Unknown | Memory usage optimizations | Both | N/A |
| [ImmediatelyFast](https://modrinth.com/mod/immediatelyfast) | Unknown | Speed up immediate mode rendering in Minecraft | Client | Effect is most noticable on CPU bottleneck and old CPU setups, according to the author |

# Situational
| Name | Incompatibilities | Description | Client / Server | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Async](https://modrinth.com/mod/async) | Moonrise, Cupboard | Async is a Fabric mod designed to improve the performance of entities by processing them in parallel threads. | Server | Based on MCMTFabric / JMT-MCMT. |

| [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric) | ViaFabricPlus, Moonrise | Improve the chunk performance of Minecraft | Both | Essential if not using VFP. VFP developer often advises users to remove C2ME to fix bugs. |
| [Cull Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/cull-leaves) | None | Adds culling to leaf blocks, providing a huge performance boost over vanilla. | Client | N/A |
| [Cull Less Leaves](https://modrinth.com/mod/qthuEuVy) | Unknown | Cull leaves while looking hot! | Client | Alternative for Cull Leaves that lets you keep more of the inside leaves |
| [Dynamic FPS](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps) | Unknown | Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background | Client | Also applies to battery mode and idle mode. Overrides Vanilla's "AFK Mode" setting. |
| [GPU Tape](https://modrinth.com/mod/gputape) | Video Tape | Fix VRAM leaks. Based on VideoTape. | Client | Vulkan compatible fork of Video Tape available on more setups (older versions, Forge setups) |

| [Palladium](https://modrinth.com/mod/mpalladium) | Unknown | Another optimizing mod, provides deduplication, improved memory control, shader/chunk/nbt optimizations and enchanced mob AI. | Client | Modrinth exclusive. |
| [ScalableLux](https://modrinth.com/mod/scalablelux) | Moonrise | A Fabric mod based on Starlight that improves the performance of light updates in Minecraft. | Both | Might not be as efficient as Starlight, as 1.20+ has most of Starlight's enhancements already added. |
| [ServerCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/servercore) | Unknown | A mod that aims to optimize the minecraft server | Server | Also works on Singleplayer / LAN servers if the host has the mod |

# Possible Snake Oil

| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Reflex AntiLag](https://modrinth.com/mod/reflex-antilag) | Unknown | Implementing Nvidia reflex in Minecraft to reduce latency | Both | Requires a GTX 9XX or later. Very lightly tested, with no benchmarks. Use with caution. |
| [RenderScale](https://modrinth.com/mod/renderscale) | Iris + Distant Horizions [^2] | Allows you to change Minecraft's render resolution separately from the HUD elements | Client | May cause lower performance, I haven't tested. Will definitely make your game look bad. Fork of ResolutionControl++. |




[^1]: Original repo only goes up to 1.21.1 but you can get 1.21.2+ if you use [drouarb's fork](https://github.com/drouarb/nvidium).

[^2]: Using Iris and Distant Horizions at once seems to cause issues with RenderScale. See [this thread](https://github.com/Zolo101/RenderScale/issues/26) for potential fixes.
